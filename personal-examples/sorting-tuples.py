### Problem 2: Sorting Tuples by the Last Element

# You have a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements. Write a lambda function that sorts this list in ascending order based on the second element of each tuple.

# **Instructions:**

# 1. Use the `sort` method with a lambda function as the key to access the last element of each tuple.
# 2. Print the sorted list.
